# CalCulator

This is an app that calculates the basal metabolic rate (BMR), which is caloric expenditure that a person's body burns when only doing basal tasks. 

This is a simplistic calculation that takes a few different variables: height, weight and age of the user, and then calculates their BMR.

## How to use

CalCulator consists of four different inputs, where the user enters some personal data which will be used to calculate their BMR. The data is age in years, weight in kilograms, height in centimetres and their gender (male or female).
